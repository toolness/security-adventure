[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/security-adventure.png)](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/security-adventure)

This repository contains an exciting quest to learn about Web security by
learning about vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and then crafting code to
protect against them.

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have the skills taught in [learnyounode][] and
[levelmeup][].

Also, make sure [phantomjs][] is installed and on your path (as well as
node and npm, of course).

## Start The Adventure!

Right now things are a bit messy, but you can start the adventure like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/toolness/security-adventure.git
cd security-adventure
npm install
cp app-vulnerable.js app.js
```

`app.js` is a full web application in about 150 lines of code that
allows users to create password-protected accounts and store private
plaintext notes in the cloud.

Run `node app.js` and then browse to http://localhost:3000 to familiarize
yourself with the behavior of the application by creating a user and saving
some notes. Then read the source of `app.js` to get a basic idea of how
everything works.

`app.js` contains lots of vulnerabilities, and your quest is to learn about
and fix all of them!

### Vulnerability: Regular Expression Denial of Service

The regular expression used to validate usernames has a 
[Regular Expression Denial of Service][redos] vulnerability in it.

Read about this vulnerability, and then try exploiting it manually by
visiting the app in your browser and entering an invalid username that
will cause the app to hang.

Then fix `app.js`. When you're done, run `bin/verify.js redos` to verify
that your solution works!

### Vulnerability: Reflected Cross Site Scripting

The home page of the app accepts a `msg` querystring argument containing
a hex-encoded status message to display. This is used, for instance, when
users fail to authenticate properly and the server needs to provide feedback.

This isn't exactly a best practice for various reasons, but most importantly,
it contains a [Reflected Cross Site Scripting][reflected] vulnerability!

Read about the vulnerability, and then try crafting a URL that, when visited,
causes a logged-in user's browser to display an alert dialog that contains
their session cookie (accessible through `document.cookie`).

#### Stopping Cookie Theft

Cookie theft is a particularly big danger because it allows attackers to
do anything on a user's behalf, whenever they want. So first, mitigate
the effects of XSS vulnerabilities by modifying `sessionCookie.serialize()`
in `app.js` to issue [HttpOnly][] cookies.

Manually test your solution by loading your specially crafted URL from
the previous section; you shouldn't see the session cookie in that
alert dialog anymore (you will have to log out and log back in for the
HttpOnly cookie to be set properly).

When you're done, run `bin/verify.js httponly` to verify that your solution
works.

#### Defining a Content Security Policy

It's nice that the damage that can be done via the XSS attack is somewhat
mitigated, but it's way better to prevent the attack entirely!

The [Content Security Policy][csp] specification is one of the most
awesome security innovations to come to browsers in recent years. It
allows servers to change the default allowances for what kinds of
script can be executed, and even what kinds of embedded resources
(such as iframes, images, and style sheets) can be included in a page. This
is in accordance with the [Principle of Least Authority][pola], which
is a good best practice for any secure system.

Since our app doesn't actually have *any* client-side script or embedded
content, we can enforce the most restrictive CSP possible by setting the
`Content-Security-Policy` header to `default-src 'none'`.

Once you've done this, load your specially crafted URL again; you shouldn't
even see an alert dialog, and your browser's debugging console might
even explain why your JS wasn't executed.

When you're done, run `bin/verify.js csp` to verify that your solution
works.

#### Stopping XSS

CSP is only available on the most modern browsers, and we need to
protect users on older ones too. Besides that, of course, we actually want
to display the message content in a correct and useful way.

This can be done by properly escaping the untrusted input coming in
from the `msg` querystring argument.

The [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet][xss-cheat-sheet] is indispensable
here. Check it out and use a reliable function like underscore's
[_.escape][] to escape the `msg` argument before inserting it into your
HTML. (Note that if you decide to use underscore, you'll want to install it
first using `npm install underscore`.)

When you're done, run `bin/verify.js reflected-xss` to verify that your
solution works.

### Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cookies are a form of [ambient authority][], which means that they get
sent with *every* request to a website--even when that request comes from
a different website!

Consider a website called killyournotes.com which contains the following
form:

```html
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
  <form method="POST" action="http://localhost:3000/">
    <input type="hidden" name="notes" value="gotcha.">
  </form>
</body>
```

Every user logged in to your application would immediately have their notes
deleted whenever they visited killyournotes.com!

Try doing this now: copy the above text and paste it into an HTML file
anywhere. Then visit the file in your browser and see what happens.

This is called a [Cross-Site Request Forgery][csrf] (CSRF) because it
involves another site "forging" a request to your application and taking
advantage of the ambient authority provided by cookies. In security
parlance, your application has unwittingly become a [confused deputy][].

This exploit can be protected against by requiring that every incoming request 
that changes your application's state (e.g. a POST request) also come with
an explicit token guaranteeing that the request indeed came from a page
on your site, and not someone else's.

To complete this mission, you'll need to do a number of things:

* When a GET request arrives at your application, check to see if the
  session has a value called `csrfToken`. If it doesn't, create one using
  [crypto.randomBytes()][] and set the session cookie.

* Whenever your site displays a form, add a hidden input with the name
  `csrfToken` to the form, and set its value to that of `session.csrfToken`.

* Whenever your site processes a POST request, ensure that the incoming form
  data has a value for `csrfToken` that matches that of `session.csrfToken`.
  If it doesn't, return a 403 (forbidden) reponse code.

Once you've done this, your exploit should result in a 403 instead of
deleting the current user's notes, and your application should still retain
all existing functionality.

When you're done, run `bin/verify.js csrf` to verify your solution.

### Hooray!

You've completed all the challenges so far. You can verify that your `app.js`
protects against all the problems you've solved, and still retains its
basic functionality, by running `bin/verify.js all`.

If you want to learn more about Web security, you should read Michal Zalewski's
[The Tangled Web][tangled]. It is hilarious and very educational.

## Goals and Future Plans

In the future, this will be a [workshopper][] workshop like
[stream-adventure][] that teaches people how to write secure code for the Web.

`app-vulnerable.js` intentionally contains a number of [OWASP][]-defined
security vulnerabilities that aren't currently part of the quest, such as:

* [Sensitive Data Exposure][sde] for password storage
* [Insecure Direct Object References][idor] /
  [Broken Authentication and Session Management][brokenauth] for session keys

Learners should first exploit these vulnerabilities, so they
understand how they work, and then modify the code to implement
defenses against them.

Ideally, the tutorial will also teach users about more recent innovations in 
browser security, such as [HTTP Strict Transport Security][hsts]. It should
also teach developers how to use security tools like the
[Zed Attack Proxy][zap] to easily detect for vulnerabilities in their
own applications.

By the end of the tutorial, users will have familiarized themselves with a
variety of types of attacks. The will also have familiarized themselves with
the OWASP website and will be equipped to independently learn about security
in the future.
